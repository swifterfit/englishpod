...like I told you before, we just don't have the resources to hire you an assistant.
I understand that, but the fact is we're understaffed.
The timing is just not right. The economy is bad, and it's too risky to take on new staff.
Yeah, I guess you're right... here's an idea, what if we hire an intern? She would take some of the weight off my shoulders.
she?
Yeah, you know, a recent graduate. She could give me a hand with some of these projects and we could keep our costs down.
That sounds reasonable...let me see what can I do.
Tony, I'd like to introduce you to your new assistant.
OK, great! Let's meet her!
Hi, I'm Adam.
Oh... hi... I'm Tony...
