Hello, Daniel speaking, how may I help you?
Hi, Daniel, Julie here.
Hi, Julie, how are you?
Actually, I'm feeling quite ill today.
I'm sorry to hear that. What's wrong?
I think I'm coming down with the flu. I have a headache, a sore throat a runny nose and I'm feeling slightly feverish.
I see.. so you're calling in sick?
Yes, I was hoping to take the day off to recover.
OK, then. Try and get some rest
