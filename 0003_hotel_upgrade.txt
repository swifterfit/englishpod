Good afternoon, What can I do for you?
I'd like to check in please, I have a reservation under the name Anthony Roberts.
All right xxx, Oh, Mr. Roberts we've been expecting you... and here is your keycard to the presidential suite.
But there must be some mistake. my reservation was for a standard room.
Are you sure？Let me double check.
Yeah... Here, this is my confirmation number.
You're right Mr. Roberts, there seems to be a mixup, unfortunately we're overbooker at the moment.
So...
Not to worry. We're pleased to offer you a complimentary upgrade.
Presidential suite baby!
