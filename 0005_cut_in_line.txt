Cut In Line
I can't believe it took us  two hours to get here. The traffic in New York is unbelievable.
Yeah, but just relax honey, we're here and we're going on vacation. In a few hours we'll be in Hawaii, and you'll be on the golf course.
Oh no! Look at that line! It must be a mile long! There's no wat i'm waiting for another two hours.
Honey... don't.
Hey man, the end of the line is over there.
Yeah.
No seriously, I was here first, and you can't cut in line like this.
Says who?
I do!
So sue me!
Alright... that's it...
