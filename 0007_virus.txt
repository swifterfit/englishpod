Virus
Oh great! This stupid computer froze again. That's the third time today. Hey Samuel, cna you come take a look at my PC? It's acting up again. It must have a virus or something.
Just give me a second, I'll be right up.
I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files.
But I'm quite carefull when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.
Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly; yours wasn't up to date, that's probably what was causing ypur problems.
OK, Anything else?

Um.. yeah.. Sorry about that.
